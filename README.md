# Gym-LunarLander-v2
My solution to solving the Gym Environment LunarLander-v2 (Discrete) using Deep Q Learning.

The code is written to be executed in an IPython console. Once loaded the model can be trained using:
```
train(training_episodes)
```
where training_episodes as desired. The model trains until all episodes have passed or until the problem is considered solved, when 100 subsequent episodes have an average reward of 200.
